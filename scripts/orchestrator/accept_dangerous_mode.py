"""Record the bypass-permissions acceptance the way Claude Code records it.

A worker starts with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, and the first time
a configuration has never accepted that mode Claude Code raises:

    WARNING: Claude Code running in Bypass Permissions mode
    In Bypass Permissions mode, Claude Code will not ask for your approval
    before running potentially dangerous commands.
    ...
    > No, exit
      Yes, I accept

A session started unattended has nobody to press Down + Enter for it, and the
failure is invisible from the launcher: `dispatch.sh` exits 0, the tmux session
is live, and `watch.sh` reports `IDLE` — the same picture as a worker thinking.

## Where it is written, and why not the obvious place

`<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` — Claude Code's `localSettings` layer,
inside the worker's own worktree, gone when the worktree is removed.

Not the person's **user** settings, even though that is what Claude Code
itself writes when somebody accepts the dialog. That is too broad: `skipDangerousMode
PermissionPrompt` in user settings turns the confirmation off for *every* Claude
Code session on the machine, not only for `gm-*` workers. On a machine where the
key is already set that write is a no-op, which is precisely what makes it
dangerous — the first machine where it is not a no-op is one nobody is watching,
and it will be quiet there too. A setting that exists to serve one dispatched
session should not outlive it.

`localSettings` gives that lifetime and is in the gate's list. `projectSettings`
(`.claude/settings.json`) — the file `dispatch.sh` seeds for a repository
without the fence hook, and the obvious place to look — is **not** in the list, so
it cannot suppress this dialog. The list is exact; see below.

## The key, and how it was found

`skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt`, in a **settings** file, not in
`.claude.json`. Read off Claude Code 2.1.259 rather than guessed:

- its own schema description is *"Whether the user has accepted the bypass
  permissions mode dialog"*;
- accepting the dialog runs
  `nn("userSettings", {skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt: true})` — the app
  writes the same file this script writes;
- the gate is `i$()`, and it is one expression:

      !!(Se("userSettings")?.skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt
      || Se("localSettings")?.skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt
      || Se("flagSettings")?.skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt
      || Se("policySettings")?.skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt)

  Four layers, and `projectSettings` is not one of them.

Corroborated on this machine: the profile's `settings.json` carries the key with
an mtime matching the minute the orchestrator hand-accepted the dialog, and
`~/.claude/settings.json` — a config directory that never saw it — does not.

And confirmed by dispatch rather than by reading: a throwaway worker launched
with the key present *only* in its worktree's `settings.local.json`, and absent
from the user settings it was pointed at, reached its prompt with no dialog.

Usage:

    python3 accept_dangerous_mode.py <worktree-path> [settings-path]

`settings-path` defaults to `claude_config.local_settings_path(<worktree>)` and
is only ever overridden by tests.

## Why this one creates the file and `pretrust_worktree.py` does not

Pre-trusting skips silently when there is no config file, on the grounds that a
machine with none has never run Claude Code. That reasoning does not carry here
at all: a fresh worktree never has a `settings.local.json`, so skipping when it
is absent would mean never writing it. The file and its directory are created.

Every other key keeps its value, and the file's mode is preserved; a created one
gets 0644, which is what Claude Code's own settings files carry. A file that
does not parse is left completely alone and the script fails loudly instead —
overwriting a settings file nobody could read would be worse than the dialog.
Writing into the worktree makes that last case cheap rather than alarming: the
file it declines to touch is one this dispatch created, not the person's.
