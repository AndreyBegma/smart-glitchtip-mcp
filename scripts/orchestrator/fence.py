"""PreToolUse fence for dispatched smart-glitchtip-mcp workers.

Up to three workers run in parallel worktrees off one repository. Each brief
names the files that worker owns; this refuses every write outside them, so the
boundary is a fact rather than a paragraph the worker was asked to remember.

No brief anywhere from the session's current directory up to its git toplevel
means this is not a worker session — the orchestrator's checkout, or a
person's — and the hook allows everything. A brief that exists but cannot be
read or parsed is the opposite case, and is refused rather than treated as no
brief: a fence that cannot read its own boundary must not
pretend there is none.

`cwd` moves, the brief does not
-------------------------------

`Bash` persists a `cd` for the rest of the session, and the harness hands this
hook the session's *current* directory as `cwd` on every later tool call — not
only `Bash`'s own. Looking for the brief only there meant one `cd` into a
subdirectory made every later call, of every tool, find no brief and allow
silently. The hook now walks up from `cwd` to find it, bounded by the git
toplevel, and computes every `rel` against the directory that holds it — never
against `cwd`, which would make a granted file look outside the fence from a
subdirectory.

`Bash`
------

The hook used to see `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` and `NotebookEdit` only, and
a heredoc, a `sed -i` or a `>` walked past it. That was not a careless worker's
exception: `bypassPermissions`, which every dispatched session runs under,
carries a standing instruction to prefer `Bash` over the file-writing tools. The
hole was the default.

So `Bash` is matched too, and the honest limits are these.

**What it sees.** A quoting- and heredoc-aware scan splits the command into
simple commands — through `;` `&&` `||` `|` and newlines, and into `$( )`,
backticks and `sh -c` — and takes the *explicit* write targets out of each:
output redirections, and the argument positions of a fixed list of commands that
write where they are told (`tee`, `sed -i`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `dd of=`,
`git apply`, …). Each target is then checked exactly as an `Edit` is, and
refused with the same words.

**Where it fails closed.** A write whose target it cannot resolve — a `$VAR`, a
substitution, a `cd` to somewhere it could not follow — is refused rather than
guessed at, and so is inline interpreter code (`python -c`, `node -e`), which is
undecidable and is not needed for read-only work.

**What it cannot see, and no shell parsing ever will.** A program that writes on
its own behalf: `bun run build`, `bun run gen:api`, `git checkout <branch>`, a
script committed in this repository. "What does this program write" is the
undecidable half of the problem. The mitigation for that half is not here — it
is `dispatch.sh` telling every worker, in the same layer the contrary
instruction arrives in, that file writes go through `Write`/`Edit`. This hook is
what stops that instruction from being prose again.

Process signals
---------------

A worker cleaning up a process it started reaches for `pkill`/`killall` by name
or pattern, and a pattern matches whatever else on the host happens to answer
to it -- `pkill -f "nest start --watch"` kills every dev server on the host
that matches, including ones belonging to unrelated projects. Nothing in the fence looked at `pkill`, `killall` or `kill`: they are
not write shapes.

They are a shape of their own now, checked the same way and through the same
scanner as a write -- past `;`, `&&`, `|`, `$( )` and `sh -c`. `pkill` and
`killall` are refused outright, in every form: there is no literal target for
either to check. `kill` is refused unless every argument that is not a signal
flag is a literal numeral -- the PID a worker captured when it started the
process -- because a job spec (`%1`), a substitution (`$(pgrep ...)`) or a
variable (`$PID`) all resolve to something the fence cannot itself verify, the
same reason a `$VAR` write target is refused.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Finding the brief
#
# `Bash` persists a `cd` for the rest of the session, and the harness hands
# this hook the session's *current* directory as `cwd` on every later tool
# call — not only `Bash`'s own. A hook that looked for the brief only there
# stopped seeing it the moment a worker's shell moved one level down, and
# `allow()` fired silently, for every tool. The brief lives at the worktree
# root; a moved `cwd` is still somewhere under it, so the fix is to walk up
# and find it.
#
# The walk is bounded by the git toplevel, not the filesystem root: a
# worker's worktree *is* a git toplevel (`dispatch.sh` creates one per slot),
# so this stops exactly at the boundary a `cd` can never carry a session past,
# and a session with no brief anywhere in its own repository — the
# orchestrator, a person — is never mistaken for a fenced one.
