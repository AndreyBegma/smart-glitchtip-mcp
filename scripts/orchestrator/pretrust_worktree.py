"""Pre-trust a worker's worktree the way Claude Code itself records trust.

`claude --remote-control` raises a first-launch "Do you trust the files in
this folder?" prompt for any project path it has never seen, and a session
started unattended has nobody to press Enter for it. Claude Code records
trust per absolute project path, under `projects.<abs path>
.hasTrustDialogAccepted` in its config file. A fresh worktree is a path
Claude Code has never seen, and it sits on the prompt until a person notices
and presses Down + Enter. `dispatch.sh`
calls this before starting the session so the prompt never appears.

## Two keys, not one

Writing only the worktree's own path keeps this launch dialog alive on a
fresh `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`:

    Quick safety check: Is this a project you created or one you trust?
    ⚠ This folder pre-approves 1 tool permission in .claude/settings.json:
      Bash(gh pr merge:*)
    ❯ No, continue without these permissions
      Yes, I trust this folder

Claude Code has two trust checks and they read different keys — see
`claude_config.canonical_git_root` for the full reading. The short version:

- the **loose** check takes either the canonical git root or a walk up from
  the session's cwd, so `projects[<worktree path>]` satisfies it;
- the **strict** one — which decides whether the project's
  `permissions.allow` rules apply, and whether that disclosure backstop is
  offered — takes `projects[<canonical git root>]` and only that.

For a linked worktree the canonical git root is the **main checkout**. So the
worktree key alone left the strict check false, the repository's own
`permissions.allow` entry raised the backstop, and the dialog appeared *with
the cancel label Claude Code only renders when trust is accepted* — which is
exactly how the pane was reported, and why `hasTrustDialogAccepted: true`
looked like it did not work.

Both keys are written. The worktree key is not redundant: it is what the loose
check's walk reads, it is the only one that exists for a plain non-git
directory, and it is what a `GLITCHTIP_MCP_REPO` other-repository dispatch
relies on. The root key is added, never substituted.

Usage:

    python3 pretrust_worktree.py <absolute-worktree-path> [claude-json-path]

`claude-json-path` defaults to whatever `claude_config.claude_json_path()`
resolves — `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when that variable is set,
`~/.claude.json` otherwise — and is only ever overridden by tests, which point
it at a fixture. A hardcoded `~/.claude.json` would be wrong on a machine with
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set: Claude Code never reads it there, so the trust would
land nowhere.

Skips silently (exit 0) if the target file does not exist — a machine with no
config file has never run Claude Code, and inventing the file is not this
script's job.
