"""Resolve the Claude Code configuration paths a dispatch pre-flight writes to.

One place, read by `dispatch.sh`, `pretrust_worktree.py` and
`accept_dangerous_mode.py`, so the fallback is not written down three times and
wrong in one of them. A machine that sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` reads trust from
`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json`, and a hardcoded `~/.claude.json` there is a
file nobody reads.

## The asymmetry, which is the whole reason to have this file

The two paths do not both live under the config directory, and assuming they do
is the mistake this module exists to stop. Read off Claude Code 2.1.259 itself
rather than inferred:

    be()  = CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? join(homedir(), ".claude")
    json  = join(process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR || homedir(), ".claude.json")

So with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set both sit under it, but with it unset the
settings file is `~/.claude/settings.json` while the config file is
`~/.claude.json` — *not* `~/.claude/.claude.json`. Confirmed on disk on this
machine: `~/.claude.json` exists and `~/.claude/.claude.json` does not.

Two smaller points, both deliberate:

- The app resolves the *directory* with `??`, so `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=""` would
  give it the empty string. Here an empty value counts as unset, which is what
  the app's own `||` already does for the `.claude.json` path.
- The real filename carries an OAuth-environment suffix — `.claude-staging-oauth
  .json`, `.claude-local-oauth.json` — which is empty on prod. A launcher has no
  business reimplementing that, so this resolves the prod name only.

Usage as a library:

    import claude_config
    claude_config.claude_json_path()
    claude_config.settings_path()

and from a shell, one path per invocation:

    python3 claude_config.py --config-dir
    python3 claude_config.py --claude-json
    python3 claude_config.py --settings
    python3 claude_config.py --canonical-git-root <path>

Every function takes an optional `env` mapping so the tests can drive it with a
fixture instead of mutating the process environment.

## The third path: which *key* inside `.claude.json`

Resolving the file was only half of it. Trust is recorded under
`projects.<path>`, and Claude Code reads two different `<path>`es depending on
what it is deciding — which is why `hasTrustDialogAccepted` written for a
worktree suppressed one dialog and not the other:

- the **loose** check (`Jo()`, "should the trust dialog appear at all") accepts
  either `projects[canonical git root]` or a walk up from the session's cwd,
  bounded by that directory's own git top level. For a linked worktree the walk
  therefore matches `projects[<worktree path>]`.
- the **strict** check (`Ld()`, "persisted trust" — whether the project's
  `permissions.allow` rules apply, and whether the permission-disclosure
  backstop is offered) reads `projects[canonical git root]` and nothing else.
  No walk.

And **the canonical git root of a linked worktree is the main checkout**, not
the worktree. Claude Code says so in its own `/cd` copy: *"This directory is
part of the repository at … Trusting it trusts that whole repository, including
its other worktrees and subdirectories."*

So a dispatch that records trust only for `~/dev/.wt-smart-glitchtip-mcp-<slot>` passes the
loose check and fails the strict one, and the worker stops on the
permission-disclosure variant of the trust dialog — with its cancel label
reading *"No, continue without these permissions"*, which is the label Claude
Code only renders when trust **is** accepted. That combination is the
fingerprint of a missing root key.

`canonical_git_root` resolves the strict key, so `pretrust_worktree.py` can
write both and neither script has to know how a worktree is laid out.
